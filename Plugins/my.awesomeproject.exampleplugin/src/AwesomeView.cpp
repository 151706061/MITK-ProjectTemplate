  // Now it's your turn. This class/method has lots of room for improvements,
  // for example:
  //
  // - What happens when multiple items are selected but the first one isn't
  //   an image? - There isn't any feedback for the user at all.
  // - What's the front item of a selection? Does it depend on the order
  //   of selection or the position in the Data Manager? - Isn't it
  //   better to process all selected images? Don't forget to adjust the
  //   titles of the UI widgets.
  // - In addition to the the displayed label, it's probably a good idea to
  //   enable or disable the button depending on the selection.
  // - You may want to copy the level window of the input image to the
  //   result image before you add it to the data storage in order to see
  //   the effect of the offset immediately. Hint: The level window is a
  //   data node property.
  // - There's a major flaw in this implementation. The AwesomeImageFilter
  //   does only work for 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional integer images,
  //   but we totally ignore this fact above. Fix it by validating the
  //   filter output (mitk::Image::IsInitialized()). A better solution
  //   would probably be to not swallow the exception in the filter itself,
  //   but to catch it here when using the filter.
